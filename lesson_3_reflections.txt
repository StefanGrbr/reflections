When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I will use this for projects which I like to edit on several different Computers 
or on which I will work with other people or maybe if I want the code to be reviewed by someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I think in this case github takes a bit of the functionality of the staging area. So I can collect some changes online and have the control when I finished all the changes to to add them to my offline version.
